# Graphs

What if you want to find the shortest path between two places (eg. two cities)?
This is when you would use a graph. Each city could be a node, and every path
between cities would be edge.

### dDefinition

A graph is an abstract data structure that can be used to represent complex, non-linear relationship between objects. Unlike a tree, a graph set at least as many edges as nodes.

### Node

Represents elements

### Edges

Represents a connection between elements.

### Representing a graph

Graphs are usually represented using an adjacency matrix. If the table has a 0 it means that the two numbers are not connected.
